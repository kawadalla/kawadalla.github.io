             <b><h2>How I completed this assignment:</h2></b>
                <p>
		I first began this assignment by thinking of some ideas of moving parts. I had an idea of using two of the rivets Joshua gave us in class
		to hold two gears together on some sort of stabilizer. I figured you move one gear and it will move the other. I designed my pieces in OnShape.
		I created a circle and followed the curvature of the circle I made and added in the shape I wanted for the gear teeth. In my exploring I found that
		OnShape had gears already made but they didn't look like what I was picturing so I made my own. I left enough space between the teeth so the teeth on 
		the other gear would fit into the empty space. When I was done with the basic shape of my gear I added in a circle for the rivets to go through. I made 
		the circle .25in based on the measurments of the rivets. I then extruded my shape to .25in thickness.
		I then created the stabilizing piece. I created a rectangle with curved edges and added in two holes for the rivets to fit into using the same size 
		as the one used in the gear. I then extruted this piece again at .25in thickness. Once I was happy with what I came up with I exported my work to a dxf file to open with Illustrator. 
		Once in Illustrator I followed the steps to lasercut my pieces out using cardboard.
