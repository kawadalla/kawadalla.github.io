             <b><h2>How I completed this assignment:</h2></b>
                <p>
		I first began this assignment by thinking of some ideas of moving parts. I had an idea of using two of the screw Joshua gave us in class
		to hold two gears together on some sort of stabilizer. I figured you move one gear and it will move the other. I designed my pieces in OnShape.
		I created a circle and followed the curvature of the circle I made and added in the shape I wanted for the gear teeth. I left enough space 
		between the teeth so the teeth on the other gear would fit into the empty space. When I was done with the basic shape of my gear I extruded it to .25 inches.
		I then created the stabilizing piece. I create a rectangle with curved edges and added in a hole for the screw to fit into using the same size 
		as the one used in the gear. Once I was happy with what I came up with I exported my work to a dxf file to open with Illustrator. Once in Illustrator I followed the steps 
		to lasercut my pieces out.

		<b>Challenges:</b>
        	<p> I actually had no issues with this assignment. My piece came out perfectly on the first try. </p>
