                <p>
			I almost didn't complete this assignment. It broke me, mentally and emotionally. *see challenges for more insight* 
			I started this assignment by searching online for a Han Solo in carbonite STL. I thought it would be cool to make for this assignment.
			Boy, was I wrong. I imported the file into Rhino. I then create a box using extrude, cap and shell. Easy. I then went to office hours on
			Sunday held by Nadya to get my wax, that I purchased because it was empahzied STRONGLY in class to purchase it. Waited...waited some more,
			found out durning my waiting that my file was "too detailed and I should probably 3D print or simplify" since I had time to kill while I waited
			for my turn at the shopbot *the turn that never came*, I simplifed and found a <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2437809">stormstrooper helmet doorknob</a>
			 I removed part of the design and
			Peter helped me cut the helmet in half and I repeated the steps above to make a box around it. Waited...waited some more. Found out that only 2 more people would get their wax run through the shopbot
			and I wasn't one of them.... Since I didn't get a turn at the shopbot I had to go and redo my file using Fusion 360, following the slides. I exported
			to Bantam and tried milling, which was a fail. I got help during office hours and things seemed to be going well until they weren't. My machine got
			unplugged and instead of putting myself through more torture and wasted time I decided to 3D print. I 3D printed my piece using my original STL file. 
			It failed twice, but Omari and Elizabeth kept an eye on my 3rd try while I tried milling. That piece turned out, bless. I mixed 1:1 of the Oomoo, mixed it and poured it into my 3D print, left it overnight
			and in the afternoon, took it out. I then went to the Mill and mixed plaster and let it set while I went to class. Came back after class and ran 3 more rounds of plaster. 
			And done, 4 stormtroopers, the clone wars if you will.
