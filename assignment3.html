             <b><h2>How I completed this assignment:</h2></b>
                <p>
		I first began this assignment by familiarizing myself with the Rhino and Grasshopper software.
        I was struggling with how to make a star shape, and went to office hours. Josh explained how the software works and gave me some guidence.
        After some trial and error I was able to make some progress, however I was still struggling to get my shape to look like my original design.
        I did a Google search to see how others may have created a star. Everything I found was extremely complex but I was able to pull some information from
        one Grasshopper question <a href="https://discourse.mcneel.com/t/regular-stars/54955">forum</a>. I made some changes to one of the files to meet my needs for this 
	assignment. I created a rectangle for the space to trim out. I was able to set the point of the rectangle to be center and added in number sliders so one can easily change the dimensions based on cardboard thickness.
 	Once I had my shape I was able to use the rdiff function to create the space to trim out. I was able to successfully bake the function!

		<p>I used the calipers and a ruler to measure the my light piece. Using the number slider I was able to input the thickness and bake the shape. I 
        repeated this step for ther other cardboard. I exported the file to as an STL file I could open in DigiLab. I then opened the STL file in Digilab and followed 
	the instructions provided in the slide deck on how to set up the file for printing.

		<b>Challenges:</b>
		<p>
        Unfortunately I didn't find out till after my piece was done printing that my measurements were slightly off and I did not account for the space that would be taken up by the edges of the cylinder. It took up space 
			on the inside rather than the outside so my light did not fit. </p>

<p> I was able adjusted the measurements to account for the space and reprinted successfully.
