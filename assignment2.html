             <b><h2>How I completed this assignment:</h2></b>
                <p>
		I first began this assignment by familiarizing myself with the Rhino and Grasshopper software.
        I was struggling with how to make a star shape, and went to office hours. Josh explained how the software works and gave me some guidence.
        After some trial and error I was able to make some progress, however I was still struggling to get my shape to look like my original design.
        I did a Google search to see how others may have created a star. Everything I found was extremely complex but I was able to pull some information from
        one Grasshopper question <a href="https://discourse.mcneel.com/t/regular-stars/54955">forum</a>. I made some changes to one of the files to meet my needs for this 
			assignment. Once I had my shape I was able to use the rdiff function
        to create the space to trim out. I added in number sliders so one can easily change the dimensions based on cardboard thickness.

		<p>Similar to last week I used the calipers to measure the thickness of my two carboards. Using the number slider I was able to input the thickness and bake the shape. I 
        repeated this step for ther other cardboard. I converted the file to an ai file I could open in Illustrator. Following the steps of last week I step up
        my artboard in regard to the cardboard dimensions. From there I created test pieces using the two different cardboard thicknesses.

		<b>Challenges:</b>
		<p>
        Unfortunately during my test pieces it came to light that my caliper measurments were off. The cardboard I was using was more compressed on the sides than the 
        area that was actaully being cut out. After measuring and checking I re-entered the thickness and repeated my original steps.
        I tried making new test pieces and was successful this time around. I than cut out the remaining pieces, put them together and gave it a shake test.
