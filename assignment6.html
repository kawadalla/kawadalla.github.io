        	<p> Wow. Where do I even begin. This assignment was a NIGHTMARE. I went to the office hours Sunday that Nadya held,
			 waited for <b> 6 HOURS </b> and left empty handed because she would not be doing anymore pieces. Went to Fluke
			 on Monday for help, the staff would not offer it. Spent the remainder of the day setting up my file to have it ready to mill.
			 Went to the Mill on Tuesday spent <b> 8 HOURS </b> tried to mill my was, was NOT successful. At this point I set up a 3D print to have as a back up. 
			 Worked on redoing my file to mill, went to office hours to get help from Joshua. Realized there is A LOT about this assignment 
			 and machine that I didn't feel was made clear in the slides or the lecture. I was having issues because my piece did not allow
			 for the tool to fit and move. My piece was also too large/deep and again messed with the tool. After getting LOTS of help from Joshua,
			 I tried milling again.

			 Also during this time my 3D print failed *YAY ME* so I had to redo that as well. After trial and error with the mill
			 Joshua and I came to the conclusion I would need to use the 1/8th piece to get the bulk of the wax out and follow with a 1/16th contour.
			 We also noted that I had to use the 1/8th end mill on some of the 1/16th contour path to create room for the 1/16th end mill. After using 
			 the adaptive 1/8th toolpath and using the 1/16 toolpath with the 1/8th end mill, things were looking good. I switched to the 1/16th piece and began waiting.
			 Some time during this process my laptop was bumped and the cord connecting my laptop to the mill got unplugged. Fantastic. Just what I needed. *cries*
			 Instead of setting everything back up, I called it quits with the wax.
