             <b><h2>How I completed this assignment:</h2></b>
                <p>
			I almost didn't complete this assignment. It broke me, mentally and emotionally. *see challenges for more insight* 
			I started this assignment by searching online for a Han Solo in carbonite STL. I thought it would be cool to make for this assignment.
			Boy, was I wrong. I imported the file into Rhino. I then create a box using extrude, cap and shell. Easy. I then went to office hours on
			Sunday held by Nadya to get my wax, that I purchased because it was empahzied STRONGLY in class to purchase it. Waited...waited some more,
			found out durning my waiting that my file was "too detailed and I should probably 3D print or simplify" since I had time to kill while I waited
			for my turn at the shopbot *the turn that never came*, I simplifed and found a stormstrooper helmet. Peter helped me cut the helmet in half and I repeated the steps above 
			to make a box around it. Waited...waited some more. Found out that only 2 more people would get their wax run through the shopbot
			and I wasn't one of them.... Since I didn't get a turn at the shopbot I had to go and redo my file using Fusion 360, following the slides. I exported
			to Bantam and tried milling, which was a fail. I got help during office hours and things seemed to be going well until they weren't. My machine got
			unplugged and instead of putting myself through more torture and wasted time. I 3D printed my piece using my original STL file. It failed twice, but Omari and 
			Elizabeth kept an eye on my 3rd try while I tried milling. That piece turned out, bless. I mixed 1:1 of the Oomoo, mixed it and poured it into my 3D print, left it overnight
			and in the afternoon, took it out. I then went to the Mill and mixed plaster and let it set while I went to class. Came back after class and ran 3 more rounds of plaster. 
			And done, 4 stormtroopers, the clone wars if you will.

        	<p> Wow. Where do I even begin. This assignment was a NIGHTMARE. I went to the office hours Sunday that Nadya held,
			 waited for <b> 6 HOURS </b> and left empty handed because she would not be doing anymore pieces. Went to Fluke
			 on Monday for help, the staff would not offer it. Spent the remainder of the day setting up my file to have it ready to mill.
			 Went to the Mill on Tuesday spent <b> 8 HOURS </b> tried to mill my was, was NOT successful. At this point I set up a 3D print to have as a back up. 
			 Worked on redoing my file to mill, went to office hours to get help from Joshua. Realized there is A LOT about this assignment 
			 and machine that I didn't feel was made clear in the slides or the lecture. I was having issues because my piece did not allow
			 for the tool to fit and move. My piece was also too large/deep and again messed with the tool. After getting LOTS of help from Joshua,
			 I tried milling again.

			 Also during this time my 3D print failed *YAY ME* so I had to redo that as well. After trial and error with the mill
			 Joshua and I came to the conclusion I would need to use the 1/8th piece to get the bulk of the wax out and follow with a 1/16th contour.
			 We also noted that I had to use the 1/8th end mill on some of the 1/16th contour path to create room for the 1/16th end mill. After using 
			 the adaptive 1/8th toolpath and using the 1/16 toolpath with the 1/8th end mill, things were looking good. I switched to the 1/16th piece and began waiting.
			 Some time during this process my laptop was bumped and the cord connecting my laptop to the mill got unplugged. Fantastic. Just what I needed. *cries*
			 Instead of setting everything back up, I called it quits with the wax.
