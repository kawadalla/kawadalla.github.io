  <b><h2>How I completed this assignment:</h2></b>
                <p>
			I began this assignment by doing some research on hinged boxes and how to create on in a CAD software.
			I used OnShape to create my box. I followed a tutorial online and modified it for my needs. I used the 
			assembly feature to make sure my pieces would fit together. I then exported my project in two parts, the box as an STL, and the lid as a rhino file. 
			Using Rhino, I then added the Han Solo STL I found on Thingiverse to the lid and resized it as needed. I then exported that
			file as an STL.

			Once I was done with my files it was time to 3D print. I followed standard 3D printer set up for the Mill.
			Because my print would take so long I waited for it to get to a good point and left the rest up to the 3D
			printer gods. I came back the following day and my print was successful.
