            How I completed this assignment:
                I first began this assignment by familiarising myself with what a press kit is.
                I then used the calipers to measure the thickness of my carboard. I wrote it down and began thinking of a kit design.
                Once I had my design I added in the spaces I wanted to connect using the thickness of the cardboard to ensure the 
                pieces would hold together.
                Since I this is my first time laser cutting I reached out to Hannah, she has experience laser cutting.
