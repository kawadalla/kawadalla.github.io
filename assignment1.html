                <br>  How I completed this assignment:</br>
                I first began this assignment by familiarising myself with what a press kit is.
                I then used the calipers to measure the thickness of my carboard. I wrote it down and began thinking of a kit design.
                Once I had my design I added in the spaces I wanted to connect using the thickness of the cardboard to ensure the 
                pieces would hold together.
                Since I this is my first time laser cutting,I reached out to Hannah since she has experience laser cutting. 
She explained to me how to use the lasercutter. I created two test pieces to check my dimensions and ensure the pieces would hold. 
I was fortunate enough that my pieces work and I moved forward with printing the remaining pieces.
