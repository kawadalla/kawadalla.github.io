             <b><h2>How I completed this assignment:</h2></b>
                <p>
		I first began this assignment by familiarizing  myself with what a press kit is.
		I then used the calipers to measure the thickness of my carboard. I wrote it down and began thinking of a kit design.
		I wanted to make sure I understood what I was doing in Illustrator correctly and consulted D'Marcus. Once I had my design I added in the spaces I wanted to connect, using the caliper measurement thickness of the cardboard, to ensure the 
                pieces would hold together. Since this is my first time laser cutting, I reached out to Hannah since she has experience laser cutting. 
		I created two test pieces to check my dimensions and my measurments were correct and the pieces would hold. 
		I had no issues with my test pieces and was able to move forward in printing the remaining pieces. For this assignment I was lucky enough 
		to not have any issues. It was a fun experience and great introduction activity to laser cutting.
