                <b><h2>How I completed this assignment:<b><h2>
                 <p>I first began this assignment by familiarizing  myself with what a press kit is.</p>
              <br>  I then used the calipers to measure the thickness of my carboard. I wrote it down and began thinking of a kit design.</br>
               <br> I wanted to make sure I understood what I was doing in Illustrator correctly and consulted D'Marcus. Once I had my design I added in the spaces I wanted to connect, using the caliper measurement thickness of the cardboard, to ensure the 
                pieces would hold together. Since I this is my first time laser cutting, I reached out to Hannah since she has experience laser cutting. </br>
<br> I created two test pieces to check my dimensions and my measurments were correct and the pieces would hold. </br>

<br> I had no issues with my test pieces and was able to move forward in printing the remaining pieces.</br>
