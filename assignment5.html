             <b><h2>How I completed this assignment:</h2></b>
                <p>
		 I used OnShape to create my pieces. I created 2 rectangles and 1 square. I did calulations based on the dimensions of my square.
		Once I had one rectanle done, I used that as a guide for my other retangle. I made sure that where a male part was on one retangle a female part would be on 
			the corresponding retangle. Once both retangles were done I used them as a guide to create the square end pieces. Again keeping note to have female and male parts correspond.
			All of my male pieces were 0.03 inches and the female pieces are 0.31 inches. I added in the extra 0.01 on the female part so the 
			male parts good fit in easily given the material.

        	<p> Two words. Dog. Bones. After several unsuccessful cuts I decided to remove the dog bones from my pieces. They were being cut out too 
		    large for my pieces and not adding any value. I felt confident that based on my calculations and the way my box was set up that I wouldn't need them.
		    I cut out two test pieces without them and was successful. I proceeded to cut out my remaining pieces and behold, a box.</p>
